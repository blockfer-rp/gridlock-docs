## What is GRIDLOCK?

GRIDLOCK is a crypto market prediction game that transforms market analysis into an engaging strategic experience. You don't need to be a crypto expert—just predict price movements and watch your score multiply through pattern completion.

### The Core Concept

Choose between two game modes:
- **Market Grid**: Predict which coins will perform best within a category
- **Coin Grid**: Predict UP or DOWN movements for individual price candles

Your predictions form a grid. Complete geometric patterns (rows, columns, diagonals, squares) to earn massive bonus points.

## What Makes GRIDLOCK Unique?

### Strategic Depth
- **Pattern Optimization**: Position predictions to complete multiple patterns simultaneously
- **Power-Up Placement**: Use ATTACK, GUARD, and RESTORE abilities strategically
- **Risk-Reward Balance**: Choose time ranges that match your prediction confidence

### Skill-Based Gameplay
- **Market Knowledge**: Understanding crypto volatility improves accuracy
- **Spatial Strategy**: Visualizing pattern opportunities maximizes scores
- **Resource Management**: Strategic power-up deployment can double your points

### Accessible Entry
- **No Wallet Required**: Play immediately without crypto setup
- **Learn by Playing**: Game mechanics teach market prediction naturally
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start simple, scale to complex strategies

## Two Ways to Play

### Market Grid Mode (4×3 Grid)

**What**: Predict relative performance among 12 coins from a category
**How**: Select coins and arrange them on the grid—no explicit predictions needed
**Strategy**: Position high-performers in pattern formations

**Categories Available**:
- **L1 Chains**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other base layer protocols
- **DeFi**: Uniswap, Aave, Curve, and decentralized finance tokens
- **Memes**: Dogecoin, Pepe, Shiba Inu, and meme-driven cryptocurrencies

**Scoring Example**:
- Full Row (4 correct): **4,000 points**
- Full Column (3 correct): **3,000 points**
- Power-up success: **+1,000 points**

### Coin Grid Mode (Variable Grid Sizes)

**What**: Predict directional movements (UP/DOWN) for price candles
**How**: Choose a coin, select time range, make predictions for each candle
**Strategy**: Identify trends and form high-value patterns

**Time Range Options**:
| Time Range | Grid Size | Candles | Base Points | Difficulty |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **24H** | 6×4 (24) | 24 × 1-hour | +25 each | Easier |
| **4H** | 4×4 (16) | 16 × 15-min | +50 each | Medium |
| **1H** | 4×3 (12) | 12 × 5-min | +75 each | Harder |

**Scoring Example (4H Mode)**:
- Each correct prediction: **+50 points**
- Full Row (4): **5,000 points**
- Diagonal (4): **8,000 points**
- Square (2×2): **3,000 points**

## Core Mechanics

### Patterns: Your Path to High Scores

Patterns are geometric formations on your grid that award massive bonus points:

**Available Patterns** (varies by grid size):
- **Rows**: Horizontal lines of correct predictions
- **Columns**: Vertical lines of correct predictions
- **Diagonals**: Corner-to-corner lines (4×4 grids only)
- **Squares**: 2×2 blocks of correct predictions
- **Four Corners**: All four corner cells (4×4 grids only)

**Key Insight**: A single correct prediction in the right position can complete multiple patterns simultaneously, multiplying your score.

### Power-Ups: Strategic Amplifiers

Place up to 3 power-ups on your grid for bonus points:

| Power-Up | Effect | When It Succeeds | Bonus |
|---------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **ATTACK** 🗡️ | Offensive capability | Placed on lowest volatility position | +1,000 pts |
| **GUARD** 🛡️ | Defensive protection | Placed on highest volatility position | +1,000 pts |
| **RESTORE** 🔄 | Recovery mechanism | Converts incorrect to correct prediction | +1,000 pts |

**Pro Tip**: Place power-ups on cells that are part of multiple patterns to maximize their impact.

### Scoring System

Your final score combines three components:

1. **Base Points**: Each correct prediction (Coin Grid only)
2. **Pattern Bonuses**: Geometric formations completed
3. **Power-Up Bonuses**: Strategic ability success

**Example Score Breakdown** (4H Coin Grid):
```
Base Points:       12 correct × 50 = 600 points
Full Row:                         5,000 points
Full Column:                      5,000 points
Diagonal (3):                     1,500 points
ATTACK Success:                   1,000 points
─────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL SCORE:                     13,100 points
```

## Key Success Principles

### Focus on Patterns, Not Just Accuracy
A 60% accuracy rate with 3 completed patterns scores higher than 80% accuracy with no patterns.

### Strategic Power-Up Placement
Power-ups on pattern intersections amplify their value—a successful power-up in multiple patterns can add 3,000-5,000 points indirectly.

### Time Range Selection Matters
- **Shorter time frames** (1H) = higher volatility = harder predictions = higher points
- **Longer time frames** (24H) = more stable trends = easier predictions = more pattern opportunities

### Market Timing
Play during active trading hours (market opens, major news) for more predictable movements.
