# How to Play

Learn how to play GRIDLOCK and maximize your score across both game modes.

## Universal Winning Principles

These principles apply to both Market Grid and Coin Grid modes:

1. **Pattern Priority**: Focus predictions on completing high-value patterns
2. **Power-Up Placement**: Position power-ups on cells within multiple patterns
3. **Market Timing**: Choose active trading periods for predictability
4. **Risk-Reward**: Shorter time frames = higher volatility but higher points

## Market Grid Mode

### Setup Phase

1. **Choose a Category**
   - L1_CHAINS: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.
   - MEMES: Dogecoin, Pepe, Shiba Inu, etc.
   - DEFI: Uniswap, Aave, Compound, etc.

2. **Select 12 Coins**
   - Fill your 4×3 grid with coins from the chosen category
   - Strategic placement matters for pattern formation

3. **Place Power-Ups** (Optional)
   - Up to 3 power-ups (one of each type)
   - Position them strategically for maximum effect

4. **Start Game**
   - Game automatically settles based on actual market performance

### Winning Strategy

- **No Explicit Predictions**: The game ranks coins by price change %
- Position high-performers in patterns (rows/columns)
- Aim for complete rows (4,000 pts) or columns (3,000 pts)
- Strategic power-up placement multiplies effectiveness
- **Goal**: Maximize pattern completion based on final rankings

### Scoring

**Market Grid (4×3)**:
- Full Row (4 correct): **4,000 points**
- Partial Row (3 correct): **800 points**
- Full Column (3 correct): **3,000 points**
- Power-up success: **+1,000 points** each

## Coin Grid Mode

### Setup Phase

1. **Select a Coin**
   - Choose from all 36 available cryptocurrencies
   - Consider recent volatility and trading patterns

2. **Choose Time Range**
   - **24H**: 24 candles (6×4 grid), longer game, +25 pts per candle
   - **4H**: 16 candles (4×4 grid), balanced difficulty, +50 pts per candle
   - **1H**: 12 candles (4×3 grid), fast-paced, +75 pts per candle

3. **Make Predictions**
   - Predict UP or DOWN for each candle in the grid
   - Consider market trends and historical patterns

4. **Place Power-Ups** (Optional)
   - Up to 3 power-ups on specific candles
   - Strategic placement for bonus points

### Winning Strategy

- **Accuracy Matters**: Each correct prediction scores base points
- **Pattern Bonuses**: Complete rows, columns, diagonals, squares
- **Grid Size Affects Scoring**:
  - Larger grids (24H): Lower per-candle points but more pattern opportunities
  - Smaller grids (1H): Higher per-candle points, fewer patterns
- **Power-Ups**: Add +1,000 bonus when successful
- **Goal**: Maximize correct predictions AND form scoring patterns

### Scoring Examples

**Coin Grid 24H (6×4)**:
- Correct prediction: **+25 points** each
- Full Row (6 correct): **12,000 points**
- Near-full Row: (5): **4,000 points** | (4): **1,000 points**
- Full Column (4): **6,000 points** | (3): **1,200 points**
- Square (2×2): **3,500 points**

**Coin Grid 4H (4×4)**:
- Correct prediction: **+50 points** each
- Full Row/Column (4): **5,000 points** each
- Diagonal (4): **8,000 points**
- Four Corners: **4,000 points**
- Square (2×2): **3,000 points**

**Coin Grid 1H (4×3)**:
- Correct prediction: **+75 points** each
- Full Row (4): **4,000 points** | (3): **800 points**
- Full Column (3): **3,000 points**
- Square (2×2): **2,500 points**

## Game Flow

### Wait State
After starting a game, it enters the WAIT state:
- Game settles based on real market data
- Duration depends on selected time range
- **Market Grid**: Rankings determined by % change
- **Coin Grid**: Candle outcomes determined by OHLC data

### Results Screen
When the game completes:
- View your final score breakdown
- See which patterns you completed
- Check power-up success
- Option to play again

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Market Grid**: Easier to learn, no explicit predictions needed
2. **Practice Pattern Recognition**: Visualize potential scoring patterns
3. **Strategic Power-Ups**: Place them where multiple patterns intersect
4. **Time Range Selection**: Start with shorter time ranges (1H) for faster learning
5. **Category Specialization**: Master one coin category before exploring others
