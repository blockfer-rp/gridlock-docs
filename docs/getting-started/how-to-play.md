# How to Play

> **Quick Summary**: Step-by-step guide to playing both game modes and maximizing your score
> **Difficulty**: Beginner
> **Time to Read**: 5 minutes

Learn how to play GRIDLOCK and develop winning strategies across both game modes.

## Before You Start: Universal Winning Principles

These strategies apply to **both** Market Grid and Coin Grid modes:

### 1. Pattern Priority
Focus predictions on completing high-value patterns rather than random accuracy:
- Visualize potential rows, columns, and diagonals before making predictions
- Position uncertain predictions outside of critical pattern cells
- Aim for 2-3 complete patterns rather than partial progress on many

### 2. Strategic Power-Up Placement
Position power-ups on cells within multiple patterns:
- ✅ **Good**: Power-up on a cell that's part of a row AND column
- ❌ **Bad**: Power-up on an isolated corner cell (unless Four Corners pattern)
- 💡 **Best**: Power-up on a cell that's part of 3+ potential patterns

### 3. Market Timing
Choose active trading periods for more predictable movements:
- **Best times**: Market opens (9:30 AM ET), major news events, high volume periods
- **Avoid**: Low liquidity hours (late night, weekends for some coins)
- **Check**: Recent volatility before selecting time ranges

### 4. Risk-Reward Balance
Shorter time frames offer higher points but harder predictions:
- **Conservative**: Start with 24H (longer trends, more patterns)
- **Balanced**: 4H mode (optimal difficulty-to-reward ratio)
- **Aggressive**: 1H mode (highest points, most volatile)

## Market Grid Mode: Complete Walkthrough

**Goal**: Arrange 12 coins strategically to maximize pattern completion based on final rankings.

### Understanding Market Grid

**No Explicit Predictions Needed**: The game automatically ranks coins by their actual price change percentage. Your strategy is positioning coins you believe will perform well in pattern formations.

**Scoring is Based on Rankings**: Coins are sorted by performance, and patterns form based on how well-positioned your high-performers are.

### Step-by-Step: Playing Market Grid

#### Phase 1: Choose a Category

**Available Categories**:
- **L1_CHAINS**: Base layer blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, etc.)
- **DEFI**: Decentralized finance protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Curve, Synthetix, etc.)
- **MEMES**: Meme-driven tokens (Dogecoin, Pepe, Shiba Inu, TRUMP, etc.)

**Selection Tips**:
- Choose a category you follow regularly
- Check recent category performance (trending vs. consolidating)
- Meme coins have highest volatility, L1 chains are more stable

#### Phase 2: Select and Arrange 12 Coins

1. **Review Available Coins**: All 12 coins from your chosen category are displayed
2. **Select Coins**: Fill your 4×3 grid with coins you believe will perform well
3. **Strategic Arrangement**:
   - **Top row**: Coins you expect to perform best
   - **Middle rows**: Moderate performers
   - **Bottom row**: Likely underperformers (but still consider pattern opportunities)

**Example Strategy** (L1_CHAINS):
```
Row 1: [ETH] [SOL] [BNB] [AVAX]  ← Expect strong performance
Row 2: [SUI] [APT] [TON] [LTC]   ← Moderate performance
Row 3: [XRP] [ZEC] [HYPE] [BTC]  ← Conservative plays
```

#### Phase 3: Place Power-Ups (Optional)

You can place up to **3 power-ups** (one of each type):

**ATTACK** 🗡️:
- **Succeeds when**: Placed on the coin with the **lowest volatility** (most stable price)
- **Strategy**: Place on established coins (BTC, ETH in L1 category)

**GUARD** 🛡️:
- **Succeeds when**: Placed on the coin with the **highest volatility** (biggest swings)
- **Strategy**: Place on meme coins or newer tokens

**RESTORE** 🔄:
- **Succeeds when**: Automatically converts one incorrect prediction to correct
- **Strategy**: Place on pattern-critical cells where you're uncertain

**Power-Up Placement Example**:
```
Row 1: [ETH-ATTACK] [SOL] [BNB] [AVAX]
Row 2: [SUI] [APT] [TON-RESTORE] [LTC]
Row 3: [XRP] [ZEC] [HYPE-GUARD] [BTC]
```

#### Phase 4: Start Game and Wait

- Click "Start Game"
- Game enters **WAIT** state
- Results settle based on real market data
- Duration: Based on selected time range

### Market Grid Scoring

**Pattern Points**:
- **Full Row** (4 correct): **4,000 points**
- **Partial Row** (3 correct): **800 points**
- **Full Column** (3 correct): **3,000 points**

**Power-Up Bonuses**:
- Each successful power-up: **+1,000 points**

**Example Final Score**:
```
Full Row (Top Row):          4,000 points
Partial Row (Middle):          800 points
Full Column (Column 2):      3,000 points
ATTACK Success:              1,000 points
RESTORE Success:             1,000 points
─────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL SCORE:                 9,800 points
```

### Market Grid Pro Tips

1. **Don't Overthink Predictions**: Focus on positioning likely winners in multiple patterns
2. **Diversify Row Strategy**: Don't put all strong performers in one row—spread across patterns
3. **Column Optimization**: Columns are worth 3,000 points—ensure at least one strong coin per column
4. **Power-Up Synergy**: RESTORE is most valuable on cells within multiple patterns

## Coin Grid Mode: Complete Walkthrough

**Goal**: Predict directional movements (UP/DOWN) for each candle and complete high-value patterns.

### Understanding Coin Grid

**Explicit Predictions Required**: For each candle on the grid, predict whether the price will close **UP** (higher than open) or **DOWN** (lower than open).

**Grid Size Varies by Time Range**: Your chosen time range determines grid dimensions and scoring.

### Step-by-Step: Playing Coin Grid

#### Phase 1: Select a Coin

**Coin Selection Strategy**:
- Choose a coin you actively follow or research
- Check recent price action (trending vs. ranging)
- Consider volatility patterns (stable vs. erratic)

**Popular Beginner Choices**:
- **BTC/ETH**: More stable, easier to predict trends
- **SOL/AVAX**: Moderate volatility, clear trend patterns
- **DOGE/PEPE**: High volatility, harder but higher potential scores

#### Phase 2: Choose Time Range

| Time Range | Grid Size | Candles | Interval | Base Points | Difficulty |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **24H** | 6×4 (24) | 24 × 1-hour | 1h | +25 each | ⭐️ Easier |
| **4H** | 4×4 (16) | 16 × 15-min | 15m | +50 each | ⭐️⭐️ Medium |
| **1H** | 4×3 (12) | 12 × 5-min | 5m | +75 each | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Harder |

**Time Range Selection Guide**:

**Choose 24H (6×4) if**:
- You're new to crypto price prediction
- You want more pattern opportunities (larger grid)
- You prefer analyzing longer-term trends

**Choose 4H (4×4) if**:
- You want balanced difficulty and rewards
- You understand 15-minute chart patterns
- You want access to diagonal patterns (+8,000 points!)

**Choose 1H (4×3) if**:
- You're experienced with short-term trading
- You can analyze 5-minute candle patterns
- You want maximum points per prediction (+75 each)

#### Phase 3: Make Predictions

For each candle on the grid, predict **UP** or **DOWN**:

**Prediction Strategies**:

**Trend Following**:
- If price is in an uptrend, predict more UP candles
- If price is in a downtrend, predict more DOWN candles
- Use recent candle history as reference

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Look for support/resistance levels
- Identify consolidation periods (mix of UP/DOWN)
- Check for momentum shifts (consecutive same-direction candles)

**Strategic Prediction Placement**:
```
Example 4H Grid (4×4):
[UP]   [UP]   [UP]   [UP]    ← Full row targeting
[UP]   [DOWN] [UP]   [DOWN]  ← Mixed predictions
[DOWN] [DOWN] [UP]   [DOWN]  ← Partial patterns
[DOWN] [DOWN] [DOWN] [DOWN]  ← Full row targeting
```

**Pro Tip**: Prioritize completing **one full row** over scattered accuracy. A complete row is worth 100× more than partial patterns.

#### Phase 4: Place Power-Ups (Optional)

Place up to **3 power-ups** on specific candles:

**ATTACK** 🗡️:
- **Succeeds when**: Placed on candle with **lowest volatility** (smallest price swing)
- **Strategy**: Place on consolidation candles (small range)

**GUARD** 🛡️:
- **Succeeds when**: Placed on candle with **highest volatility** (biggest price swing)
- **Strategy**: Place on breakout/breakdown candles (large range)

**RESTORE** 🔄:
- **Succeeds when**: Automatically converts one incorrect prediction to correct
- **Strategy**: Place on pattern-critical cells (e.g., completing a diagonal)

**Power-Up Placement Example** (4×4 Grid):
```
[UP]   [UP-RESTORE] [UP]   [UP]    ← RESTORE on critical row cell
[UP]   [DOWN]       [UP]   [DOWN]
[DOWN] [DOWN]       [UP-GUARD] [DOWN]  ← GUARD on volatile candle
[DOWN] [DOWN-ATTACK] [DOWN] [DOWN] ← ATTACK on stable candle
```

#### Phase 5: Start Game and Wait

- Click "Start Game"
- Game fetches real market data for your selected time range
- Results settle based on actual candle OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data
- Duration: Matches your selected time range (1H, 4H, or 24H)

### Coin Grid Pro Tips

1. **Prioritize One Full Row**: Focus predictions to guarantee at least one complete row—this alone is worth 50-160× individual predictions
2. **Diagonal Dominance (4H only)**: In 4×4 grids, diagonals are worth 8,000 points—the highest single pattern bonus
3. **Pattern Intersections**: A correct prediction at a row-column intersection counts toward both patterns (double value)
4. **RESTORE Power-Up**: Place on the cell that, if correct, would complete the most valuable pattern (e.g., final diagonal cell)
5. **Market Context**: Check recent trend before predicting—strong trends have higher directional consistency

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Random Prediction Placement
**Problem**: Predicting without considering pattern opportunities
**Solution**: Visualize rows/columns first, then make predictions to complete them

### Mistake 2: Wasting Power-Ups on Isolated Cells
**Problem**: Placing power-ups on cells that aren't part of multiple patterns
**Solution**: Only place power-ups on cells within 2+ potential patterns

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Market Context
**Problem**: Making predictions without checking recent price action
**Solution**: Review last 24h of price movement before starting (especially for Coin Grid)

### Mistake 4: Overcomplicating Market Grid
**Problem**: Trying to predict exact rankings instead of focusing on positioning
**Solution**: Identify 4-5 likely strong performers, arrange them in row/column formations

### Mistake 5: Choosing Wrong Time Range
**Problem**: Starting with 1H (hardest) as a beginner
**Solution**: Progress: Market Grid → 24H Coin Grid → 4H → 1H

---

## Tips for Success

### Market Analysis
- **Check volatility**: Use TradingView or CoinGecko for recent price action
- **News awareness**: Major announcements can swing meme coins significantly
- **Volume indicators**: High volume = more predictable movements

### Pattern Strategy
- **Row priority**: Rows are generally highest-value patterns
- **Column fill**: Ensure every column has at least 1-2 strong predictions
- **Diagonal focus (4×4)**: In 4H mode, diagonals are worth 8,000 points—plan around them

### Power-Up Mastery
- **RESTORE = Insurance**: Use on pattern-critical cells where you're 50/50 uncertain
- **ATTACK on Stablecoins**: In Market Grid, place on BTC/ETH (usually lowest volatility)
- **GUARD on Memes**: In Market Grid, place on high-volatility meme coins

### Time Management
- **Play during active hours**: Higher trading volume = more predictable patterns
- **Don't rush**: Spend 2-3 minutes analyzing before starting
