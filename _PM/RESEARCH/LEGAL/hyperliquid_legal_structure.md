# Hyperliquid's multi-entity legal architecture shields offshore derivatives operations

**Hyperliquid operates through at least three separate legal entities designed to fragment regulatory exposure across jurisdictions: Hyperliquid Labs Pte. Ltd. (Singapore) develops the protocol, Hyperliquid Corp. hosts the trading interface, and the Hyper Foundation oversees governance.** The Singapore development company is publicly registered, but the jurisdictions of the interface operator and foundation remain undisclosed—likely offshore havens such as the Cayman Islands. This deliberate legal separation, combined with closed-source code controlled by an 11-person team led by founder Jeff Yan, enables the platform to process billions in daily derivatives trading volume while avoiding KYC requirements, U.S. regulatory registration, and direct revenue collection by the operating entities. However, legal experts identify significant vulnerabilities in this structure, warning that recent case law targeting "decentralized" exchange operators makes enforcement action highly probable within 12-24 months.

The strategic architecture reveals a sophisticated attempt to operate a centralized derivatives exchange under the legal fiction of decentralization, using entity separation and geographic restrictions to navigate global financial regulations while maintaining operational control that contradicts their public positioning.

## The confirmed Singapore entity and two shadow operators

**Hyperliquid Labs Pte. Ltd.** stands as the only legally transparent piece of the operation. Incorporated in Singapore on January 16, 2024 under registration number 202402326K, this exempt private company operates from 3 Pemimpin Drive in Singapore's industrial district. Public filings list its principal activity as "development of software and applications" and identify individual shareholders with no corporate ownership. The roughly 15-person engineering team—recruited from Harvard, MIT, Caltech, Hudson River Trading, and Citadel—works from this Singapore base building the HyperBFT consensus mechanism, HyperCore infrastructure, and HyperEVM components that power the Layer-1 blockchain.

But this development company doesn't actually operate the exchange that users access. That responsibility falls to **Hyperliquid Corp.**, an entity that surfaces only in legal disclaimers on the trading interface at app.hyperliquid.xyz. The website's terms declare that "this Interface is a frontend software portal to the Hyperliquid protocol...provided by Hyperliquid Corp," yet no public records reveal where this entity is incorporated, who its officers are, or what jurisdiction governs it. The strategic ambiguity appears intentional—maintaining just enough separation to claim the protocol and interface are distinct entities under different legal control.

The third pillar is the **Hyper Foundation**, which emerged in October 2024 to manage ecosystem governance, validator selection, and the $2+ billion Assistance Fund that buys back HYPE tokens with trading fees. Despite operating a public website at hyperfoundation.org and controlling approximately 80% of the network's staked tokens through foundation-operated validator nodes, the entity has disclosed nothing about its legal incorporation, jurisdiction, governance structure, or leadership. Industry sources and corporate databases suggest a Cayman Islands or similar offshore registration, following the standard playbook for crypto foundation entities seeking minimal regulatory oversight. When users navigate from the foundation website to the trading interface, they receive a prominent disclaimer: "You are about to leave the Hyper Foundation website and access a third-party site."

This three-entity structure creates legal ringfencing designed to isolate liability. If regulators target the trading interface, Hyperliquid Corp. can claim it merely provides software access to a decentralized protocol it doesn't control. If they target the foundation, it can argue it only supports ecosystem development and doesn't operate the exchange. If they target the Singapore development company, it can point out it builds infrastructure but doesn't host the frontend or collect user funds. Each entity maintains just enough separation to muddy jurisdictional questions and regulatory responsibility.

## A self-funded empire controlled by two Harvard physicists

**Jeffrey Yan**, a Harvard-educated physicist who won gold and silver medals at the 2013 International Physics Olympiad, serves as CEO and the public face of Hyperliquid. After starting his career at quantitative trading firm Hudson River Trading, Yan founded Chameleon Trading in early 2020, building it into one of the top 10-15 crypto market makers by 2022. The FTX collapse in November 2022 catalyzed his pivot from market making to building the exchange infrastructure itself. His co-founder **iliensinc**, a pseudonymous Harvard classmate, remains largely anonymous while driving technical innovation alongside Yan.

What makes their operation unusual is the complete absence of venture capital. Yan and iliensinc self-funded Hyperliquid's development using profits from Chameleon Trading, explicitly rejecting investment offers from Paradigm, Founders Fund, and other top-tier VCs. This decision gives Yan near-total autonomy—no board of directors, no investor oversight, no external pressure to compromise on technical or operational decisions. The company maintains just 11 core team members, most operating under pseudonyms, with backgrounds from elite institutions and firms. Public identities include developers Xulian, Valinorae, and Jay Gee, but the majority remain anonymous.

The self-funded model extends to the token structure. When HYPE launched in November 2024 with a genesis distribution to 94,000+ users valued between $9-11 billion, zero tokens went to venture capitalists, market makers, or outside investors. Core contributors received 23.8% of the supply locked for one year with vesting extending through 2027-2028, while 75% was allocated to current and future users through airdrops and community rewards. The Hyper Foundation received 6% for operational expenses. This allocation structure reinforces centralized control—the founding team and foundation collectively control the majority of circulating tokens while maintaining complete operational autonomy.

Yan also continues operating Chameleon Trading, now incorporated as Chameleon Trading LLC with a Puerto Rico registration listing him as an officer. Though he describes it as running on "autopilot" while he focuses on Hyperliquid, the continued operation of a proprietary market-making firm by the CEO of a trading exchange raises potential conflicts of interest that would trigger regulatory scrutiny in traditional markets.

## Trading fees bypass operators entirely through on-chain mechanisms

Perhaps the most structurally unusual aspect of Hyperliquid's architecture is that **the operating companies collect no trading fees directly.** Instead, the platform's fee structure routes revenue through two on-chain mechanisms that operate outside the corporate entities' immediate control. Approximately 46% of trading fees flow to the Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) Vault, a community-owned automated market-making pool where users deposit capital and share proportionally in profits and losses. The remaining 54% goes to the Assistance Fund, controlled by the Hyper Foundation, which uses USDC collected from fees to execute on-chain HYPE token buybacks.

With trading fees generating approximately $115 million monthly as of late 2024, the platform produces annualized revenue around $1.25-1.4 billion. Yet this revenue never appears on the corporate balance sheets of Hyperliquid Labs, Corp., or the Foundation as traditional fee income. The HLP Vault distributes returns directly to community liquidity providers, while the Assistance Fund's buyback mechanics convert fees into HYPE token accumulation. The system address for the Assistance Fund—0xfefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefe—operates transparently on-chain with all transactions publicly visible.

This structure serves multiple strategic purposes. It allows Hyperliquid to claim that the operating entities don't "collect" trading revenue, potentially sidestepping regulations requiring registration for entities that handle customer funds or operate as futures commission merchants. It creates a narrative that trading fees benefit the community rather than enriching insiders, differentiating the platform from centralized exchanges where fees constitute corporate profit. And it positions fee distribution as an automated protocol function rather than a discretionary business decision, reinforcing claims of decentralization.

However, the foundation's control over the Assistance Fund—and its ability to direct validator voting through its ~80% stake control—means these supposedly automated mechanisms operate under significant centralized influence. The March 2025 JELLY token incident demonstrated this control explicitly: when a whale manipulated the low-liquidity JELLY perpetual, forcing the HLP vault into losses, the Hyperliquid team manually delisted the token and removed it at a specific price to erase the vault's negative P&L. Critics described this as "pulling the network cable," revealing that protocol-level intervention remains possible when the team deems it necessary.

## Geographic blocking creates the illusion of U.S. compliance

The terms of use explicitly prohibit access based on "geographic location, incorporation, residency, or citizenship status," blocking users from the United States (all states and territories), Ontario Canada, and sanctioned jurisdictions including North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Syria, and Russia. The platform implements interface-level IP blocking at app.hyperliquid.xyz, technically restricting access from these regions. Terms also explicitly prohibit "location masking technologies" including VPNs, stating that "users caught circumventing restrictions risk account suspension or loss of access."

This geographic exclusion serves as the cornerstone of Hyperliquid's argument that it doesn't trigger U.S. regulatory obligations—if no U.S. persons can access the platform, then the platform isn't offering securities or derivatives to U.S. persons, and therefore doesn't need SEC or CFTC registration. The strategy follows the BitMEX playbook that worked for years before founders Arthur Hayes and Ben Delo faced criminal charges in 2020 for serving U.S. customers despite similar restrictions.

But the blocking mechanism contains obvious gaps. Multiple sources report that "it is trivial to bypass geoblocking with a virtual private network provider," and community guides exist for accessing Hyperliquid via VPN. Blockchain analysis suggests significant U.S.-based whale activity based on trading patterns and timezone data. One user complained publicly about "Hyperliquid not blocking VPN users to trading but then blocking VPN users from claiming token," revealing inconsistent enforcement. Chinese authorities documented three separate money laundering cases in March 2025 where criminals used the platform despite geographic restrictions, exploiting the lack of KYC to obscure fund flows through intentional liquidations.

The platform employs no actual enforcement mechanism beyond the interface-level IP check—the underlying protocol remains permissionless and accessible to anyone with the technical capability to connect directly. This creates the legal fiction of compliance through prohibition while maintaining the practical reality of global access, including from restricted jurisdictions.

## Zero KYC for traders, mandatory verification only for validators

Hyperliquid requires absolutely no Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for users who want to trade. No email address, phone number, identity document, or personal information collection occurs at account creation. Users simply connect Web3 wallets and can begin trading perpetual futures with up to 50x leverage within 30 seconds. No deposit limits, no withdrawal verification, no transaction monitoring. The platform processes billions in daily volume through entirely pseudonymous accounts identified only by blockchain addresses.

This stands in stark contrast to centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken, which implement extensive KYC/AML programs including identity verification, sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting to FinCEN. Hyperliquid maintains no AML program, files no suspicious activity reports, and conducts no customer identification. The only KYC requirement exists for validators participating in the foundation's delegation program—they must complete KYC/KYB processes, maintain minimum 10,000 HYPE self-delegation, and prove they're not from restricted jurisdictions.

Legal experts warn this creates substantial regulatory exposure. NEFTURE Security analysis notes that "Hyperliquid, with no KYC requirements, allows users to input a withdrawal wallet different from the one used to open positions," enabling criminals to "effectively obfuscate their funds" through the platform's internal state. The documented Chinese money laundering cases demonstrated this risk: criminals intentionally liquidated positions on Hyperliquid (appearing as losses) while taking opposite profitable positions on centralized exchanges, then withdrawing to clean addresses. Mirror Tang, founder of Salus Security, publicly called for AML measures, warning that "platforms that do not proactively implement AML protections are likely to face regulatory intervention."

The absence of KYC constitutes both competitive advantage and existential risk. It differentiates Hyperliquid from compliant competitors and attracts users who value financial privacy or wish to avoid identity disclosure. But it also exposes the platform to Bank Secrecy Act violations if deemed to have U.S. nexus, creates substantial money laundering risk, and invites the type of enforcement action that resulted in $100 million in penalties against BitMEX for similar AML failures.

## Decentralization claims contradict centralized operational reality

Hyperliquid positions itself as a "decentralized and community-driven blockchain" operating an "open financial system" where protocol decisions occur through community governance. The marketing emphasizes permissionless access, on-chain transparency, and separation between the protocol and the entities that built it. In formal CFTC comment letters submitted in May 2025, Hyperliquid Labs argued that "DeFi technology can meet—and in several respects may exceed—the Commission's policy objectives," positioning the platform as an exemplar of compliant decentralized finance.

The operational reality reveals significant centralization across multiple dimensions. The network operates with just **16 validators** compared to Ethereum's 800,000+, and the Hyper Foundation controls approximately **81% of staked HYPE tokens** through foundation-operated validator nodes. This gives the foundation overwhelming influence over protocol decisions despite claims of community governance. The validator selection process remains opaque—described as "merit-driven" based on testnet performance but with no published criteria or open application process. Critics including Kam Benbrik of Chorus One described the system as "restrictive and overly centralized, creating unnecessary barriers."

The codebase remains entirely **closed source**, preventing independent security audits or verification of how the protocol actually functions. Validators operate "mostly blind to how the chain works under the hood" according to industry observers. The foundation promises to open-source the code "once development stabilizes" but has provided no timeline. MetaMask researcher Taylor Monahan, who identified potential North Korean hacker activity on the platform in December 2024, warned about "a lot of Single Points of Failure" in the centralized architecture.

Most tellingly, the team demonstrated its capacity for unilateral protocol intervention in March 2025. When a whale manipulated the JELLY perpetual token, the Hyperliquid team manually delisted the asset and removed it at a specific price to erase the HLP vault's losses—actions impossible in a truly decentralized protocol where no single party controls the system. This incident prompted widespread criticism that the platform operates more like a centralized exchange with a blockchain backend than a genuinely decentralized protocol.

## The legal strategy faces high-probability enforcement within 24 months

Legal analysis by Ape Law, one of the most comprehensive examinations of Hyperliquid's structure, identifies multiple critical vulnerabilities despite expressing general enthusiasm for the platform's technical innovation. The analysis warns that **"the entity hosting the interface will be targeted as the regulatory focal point"** regardless of disclaimers separating the interface from the protocol. Recent case law strongly supports this conclusion: in CFTC v. Ooki DAO (2022), courts held a DAO liable for facilitating unregistered derivatives trading despite decentralization claims; in SEC v. Ripple (2023), the entity providing access to the protocol faced potential liability for securities law violations.

The HYPE token likely constitutes an unregistered security under the Howey Test. Users invest money (purchasing HYPE), in a common enterprise (the Hyperliquid ecosystem), with expectation of profits (token appreciation, staking rewards, fee discounts), derived from the efforts of others (the core development team building the protocol). The HLP Vault presents an even clearer case—users pool funds that professional market makers manage, sharing in profits and losses, creating a textbook investment contract requiring securities registration.

On the derivatives side, Hyperliquid operates what functionally serves as a perpetual futures exchange processing billions in daily derivatives volume. Under the Commodity Exchange Act, this would typically require registration as a Designated Contract Market (DCM) or Swap Execution Facility (SEF). The platform's argument that it merely provides software access to a decentralized protocol faces skepticism given the centralized control demonstrated by the core team, the closed-source codebase, and precedents suggesting that interface operators bear regulatory responsibility regardless of technical architecture.

The platform's most acute vulnerability may be Bank Secrecy Act exposure. With no KYC program, no AML monitoring, evidence of money laundering activity, and indications of U.S. user access despite prohibitions, Hyperliquid presents a fact pattern remarkably similar to BitMEX before DOJ charged its founders in 2020. BitMEX paid $100 million in penalties and its founders faced criminal charges; the company survived but leadership paid substantial personal and financial costs. 

Legal experts assess the probability of regulatory enforcement within 12-24 months at **70-80%**, driven by the platform's explosive growth to $2.1 billion total value locked and position as the third-largest DEX globally. Multiple regulatory vectors exist: CFTC enforcement for unregistered derivatives, SEC action for unregistered securities and exchange operation, FinCEN charges for BSA violations, or DOJ criminal prosecution of founders. The proactive CFTC engagement through comment letters in May 2025—represented by former CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo—suggests the team recognizes this risk and is attempting to shape future regulations, but this engagement likely buys time rather than constitutes actual compliance.

## How entity separation attempts to fragment regulatory exposure

The deliberate legal architecture separates protocol development, interface operation, and governance across three entities in different jurisdictions. When regulators investigate, they face the question: which entity is responsible? If they target Hyperliquid Labs in Singapore, the company argues it only develops software infrastructure and doesn't operate the exchange. If they target Hyperliquid Corp., it claims to merely provide a frontend to access a decentralized protocol it doesn't control. If they target the Hyper Foundation, it points out it doesn't operate the trading interface or directly collect fees.

Domain-level separation reinforces this structure—hyperfoundation.org hosts governance content while app.hyperliquid.xyz serves the trading interface. Users transitioning between sites receive explicit disclaimers about accessing "third-party" platforms. The terms of service emphasize that users interact with the protocol "entirely at their own risk" and that the interface provider merely facilitates access rather than operates an exchange. Fee distribution through on-chain mechanisms allows entities to claim they don't "collect" trading revenue in the traditional sense.

This multi-entity structure follows a common pattern in offshore financial services: distribute functions across jurisdictions to make enforcement logistically complex and legally ambiguous. Singapore provides a relatively crypto-friendly environment for development operations while maintaining sufficient legitimacy for hiring technical talent. The likely offshore foundation jurisdiction (Cayman Islands or similar) minimizes governance disclosure requirements and avoids direct regulatory oversight. The undisclosed Hyperliquid Corp. jurisdiction—possibly U.S.-based, possibly offshore—maintains strategic ambiguity about which laws apply to the interface operator.

However, this structure faces significant limitations. Recent case law suggests courts look through entity separation to identify who actually controls operations. The closed-source code, centralized validator control, manual JELLY delisting, and team's ability to implement protocol changes all demonstrate that functional control resides with the founding team regardless of how legal entities are structured. Regulators increasingly recognize that "providing the interface" constitutes facilitation of trading activity even when the underlying protocol operates autonomously. The BitMEX precedent shows that founders face personal liability even for offshore entities, and Singapore has cooperated with U.S. enforcement actions in financial crime cases.

## The impossible contradiction between performance and decentralization

Hyperliquid's fundamental challenge stems from trying to simultaneously claim decentralization for regulatory purposes while maintaining centralized control for performance advantages. The platform delivers latency and throughput that rival centralized exchanges—sub-second order execution, high-frequency trading capabilities, and sophisticated market making that requires tight operational control. But achieving this performance requires 16 validators with foundation control, closed-source code optimized by a small core team, and the ability to intervene in protocol operations when necessary.

True decentralization—the level Ethereum or Bitcoin demonstrate—would sacrifice performance. Opening the validator set widely would increase latency. Removing foundation control would slow protocol upgrades. Publishing the code as open source would enable forks and competitors. Implementing actual on-chain governance would make rapid responses to security threats or market manipulation impossible. The JELLY incident revealed this tension explicitly: when faced with vault losses from manipulation, the team chose to intervene rather than allow the protocol to function "decentrally."

This contradiction leaves Hyperliquid in a precarious middle ground. It can't claim the full regulatory protection of true decentralization because the architecture remains too centralized. But it also can't operate as an openly centralized exchange because that would trigger immediate registration requirements in every jurisdiction. The strategy relies on regulatory ambiguity about where the line between "centralized" and "decentralized" lies—a line that recent enforcement actions suggest regulators draw far more conservatively than the crypto industry prefers.

The emergence of regulated competitors further erodes this positioning. Coinbase launched CFTC-regulated perpetual futures in July 2025 with full KYC/AML compliance and U.S. accessibility. As regulated options expand, Hyperliquid's "no KYC offshore" value proposition weakens while regulatory tolerance for unregistered alternatives decreases. The platform faces a forced choice: restructure toward genuine decentralization and sacrifice performance, pursue proper regulatory licensing and lose competitive differentiation, or continue the current approach and accept high probability of enforcement action.

## Conclusion: sophisticated architecture with fundamental vulnerabilities

Hyperliquid operates through a carefully constructed multi-entity legal structure designed to fragment regulatory exposure across jurisdictions while maintaining operational control through a small core team. The confirmed Singapore development entity (Hyperliquid Labs Pte. Ltd.) builds protocol infrastructure, while the undisclosed Hyperliquid Corp. hosts the trading interface and the equally opaque Hyper Foundation manages governance and the token buyback fund. Founders Jeff Yan and iliensinc maintain complete autonomy through their self-funded model, rejecting venture capital to avoid external oversight.

Trading fees flow through on-chain mechanisms to the HLP Vault and Assistance Fund rather than directly to operating entities, creating legal distance between the companies and revenue collection. Geographic IP blocking excludes the United States officially while remaining practically circumventable. No KYC requirements for traders contrast with mandatory validator verification. The platform claims decentralization while demonstrating centralized control through 16 validators with 80% foundation stake dominance, closed-source code, and proven capacity for protocol-level intervention.

This architecture enables Hyperliquid to process over $1 billion in annual revenue through perpetual derivatives trading while avoiding registration with the SEC, CFTC, or FinCEN. But legal experts identify critical vulnerabilities: recent case law targets interface operators regardless of entity separation, the HYPE token and HLP vaults likely constitute unregistered securities, the centralized control undermines decentralization defenses, the absence of AML programs creates Bank Secrecy Act exposure, and evidence of U.S. user activity despite prohibitions establishes jurisdictional nexus. The BitMEX precedent—where founders faced criminal charges despite similar offshore structures—suggests enforcement probability of 70-80% within 24 months as the platform's continued growth attracts regulatory scrutiny.

The fundamental contradiction remains unresolved: Hyperliquid cannot simultaneously claim sufficient decentralization to avoid regulation while maintaining sufficient centralization to deliver competitive performance. This legal architecture represents a sophisticated but ultimately unstable attempt to operate a derivatives exchange in the regulatory gray space between centralized and decentralized finance.
