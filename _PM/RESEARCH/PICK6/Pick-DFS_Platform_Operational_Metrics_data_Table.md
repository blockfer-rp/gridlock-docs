## Key Data Corrections & Clarifications

### Critical Corrections to Provided Data:
1. **Flutter Entertainment Revenue**: Actual 2024 revenue was **$14.048 billion**, NOT $5.79B as stated in the task. The $5.79B figure does not match any Flutter metric.
2. **Best Ball Mania IV Prize Pool**: Total entry fees were $16.93M; prize pool was **$15M** (not $16.9M). Take rate calculates to **11.42%** (not 11.2%).
3. **DraftKings "Other" Segment**: Pick6 is part of a 7% "Other" segment (~$330M) that also includes traditional DFS, Jackpocket (acquired May 2024), advertising, and media. **Pick6 revenue is NOT separately disclosed**.
4. **FanDuel Picks Pick Range**: Actual range is **3-6 picks** (not 3-8 picks as stated).
5. **Massachusetts June 2023 Data**: Pick6 had not launched yet (launched Dec 2023), so the DraftKings data represents traditional DFS, not Pick6.

### Important Context:
- **PrizePicks Market Share (53%)**: Applies specifically to three tracked states (Massachusetts, Arizona, Michigan) that publicly report operator-level revenue. Nationwide market share is not publicly available.
- **Take Rates**: Only verifiable through state regulatory data. PrizePicks shows ~19% hold in Massachusetts (peer-to-peer Arena format may differ). DraftKings Pick6 estimated 15-20% is unverified. Underdog's Best Ball Mania IV shows 11.42% calculated take.
- **NFL Volume**: While specific "40%+ of entry fees" was not directly verified, 60-80% user participation in fantasy football and 58.8% of fantasy sports revenue from football strongly support NFL as the dominant sport.
