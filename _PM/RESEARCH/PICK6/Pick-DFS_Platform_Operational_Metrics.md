# Pick'em/DFS Platform Operational Metrics: Four-Way Analysis

**PrizePicks dominates the pick'em DFS market with over $1 billion in entry fees and 53% market share in tracked states**, operating profitably with $339M in adjusted EBITDA. Meanwhile, DraftKings and FanDuel—despite their sportsbook dominance—disclose virtually no Pick6-specific metrics, revealing how these products remain strategic experiments rather than revenue drivers. Underdog Fantasy has carved out a strong #2 position with 4 million customers and category leadership in Best Ball tournaments, though all platforms face significant data disclosure gaps regarding daily volumes and sport-specific breakdowns.

This research reveals a critical asymmetry: independent operators PrizePicks and Underdog provide substantial operational transparency through funding announcements and state gaming disclosures, while publicly-traded DraftKings and FanDuel bury pick'em products within consolidated reporting. The peer-to-peer pivot across all platforms (2024-2025) reflects regulatory pressure, fundamentally reshaping payout structures from fixed-odds to variable pooled prizes. NFL drives the market, accounting for an estimated 40%+ of volume based on promotional emphasis and tournament structures, though precise sport-specific data remains proprietary across all four platforms.

## Entry cost architecture across platforms

All four platforms converge on **$1 minimum entries** as the industry standard, making pick'em DFS accessible to casual players while enabling high-volume participation. PrizePicks and DraftKings Pick6 both cap individual entries at $150, with PrizePicks additionally imposing user-specific maximums based on account history and experience level. Underdog Fantasy offers the widest entry range, from $1 Pick'em contests to $10,000 Best Ball tournaments, including its flagship Best Ball Mania at $25 per entry (150-entry maximum per user). FanDuel Picks maintains the simplest structure with universal $1 contests, where players enter any dollar amount automatically divided into separate $1 entries.

**Common price points cluster at $1, $5, $10, $25, and $50** across platforms, with $5 emerging as the most promoted entry level based on new-user bonus structures. PrizePicks emphasizes "$5 first lineup" bonuses ($50 bonus when playing first $5+ lineup), while FanDuel launched with "$60 for $5 play" promotions. These tiered structures balance accessibility with revenue optimization, as operators can scale users from micro-stakes ($1) to power-user levels ($100+) as engagement increases.

**Sport-specific pricing variations are minimal to nonexistent**. All platforms apply identical entry fee structures across NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and other sports, with the exception of Underdog's sport-specific Best Ball tournaments (NFL Best Ball Mania at $25, PGA major-based tournaments at varying entry levels). The only documented sport-specific cost change: PrizePicks esports entry fees increased 110%+ from 2022 to 2023, indicating growing volume justifying higher-stakes contests.

Pick requirements vary strategically: PrizePicks offers 2-6 pick lineups, DraftKings Pick6 requires 2-6 picks (3 minimum in Colorado), Underdog Fantasy allows 2-8 picks with its Pick8 product, and FanDuel Picks mandates 3-6 picks. These structural differences reflect competitive positioning—PrizePicks and Underdog allow two-pick entries to capture casual players, while FanDuel's three-pick minimum pushes users toward higher-skill, higher-margin contests.

## Daily volume metrics: transparency gaps reveal competitive dynamics

**PrizePicks stands alone in disclosing meaningful volume data**, though even market leaders provide limited granularity. The platform processed over $1 billion in entry fees during 2024 (70% YoY growth) with 10+ million total users who have won "billions" collectively. State-level disclosures provide the clearest picture: Massachusetts data from August 2022-June 2023 shows PrizePicks captured $53.6M in entries over 11 months, translating to roughly $4.9M monthly or $58.7M annualized for a single state. Massachusetts June 2023 alone generated $3M in entries. Given PrizePicks operates in 45+ states, these state-level figures validate the $1B+ total entry volume claim.

The platform's 3 million registered players and "millions of monthly active users" indicate strong engagement, though exact monthly active user (MAU) counts remain undisclosed. Growth trajectory is exceptional: 3,712% revenue growth over three years (2020-2023), with 2022 showing 500% YoY increases. The 2024 period marking 70% growth suggests market maturation but continued expansion.

**Underdog Fantasy provides selective transparency through Best Ball Mania disclosures**, offering a proxy for platform scale. Best Ball Mania IV (2023 NFL season) attracted 677,376 entries at $25 each, generating $16.9M in gross entry fees from a single tournament. Best Ball Mania V (2024) was nearly identical at 672,672 entries ($16.8M), suggesting market saturation for this specific format after explosive 190% growth from 2021-2022 (155,500 to 451,200 entries) and 50% growth 2022-2023. With 4 million total customers as of March 2025, Underdog's Best Ball Mania participation rate reaches approximately 17% of its user base, though many users enter multiple lineups (maximum 150 per person).

The company's $35-56M annual revenue estimates (conflicting sources) divided by 4 million users yields **$9-14 average revenue per user annually**, indicating lower monetization than PrizePicks but broader customer acquisition. Underdog's ranking as the 4th most downloaded sports gaming app in the US (behind DraftKings, FanDuel, and likely BetMGM) confirms substantial market presence despite revenue trailing PrizePicks significantly.

**DraftKings and FanDuel provide zero Pick6/Picks-specific volume metrics** in public disclosures. DraftKings' SEC filings bury Pick6 within the "Other" segment (7% of $4.77B total revenue = ~$330M, which includes traditional DFS, digital lottery, and advertising—Pick6 likely represents $15-35M or 1.5-3.5% of PrizePicks' scale based on analyst estimates). DraftKings company-wide metrics show 10.1 million total customers and 4.8 million monthly unique payers (MUPs) in Q4 2024, up 36% YoY, but Pick6's contribution remains opaque.

FanDuel Picks launched August 2025, making it only three months old with no disclosed metrics whatsoever. Flutter Entertainment's Q3 2025 earnings call didn't mention Picks product performance, focusing instead on overall FanDuel metrics: 17 million total customers, 4.5 million average monthly players on sportsbook, $5.79B revenue (2024). The silence suggests Picks remains immaterial to overall results.

**Peak volume periods align with NFL Sundays industry-wide**, though specific peak-day volumes vs. baseline activity remain undisclosed. PrizePicks' 2021 data point of 8 million entries paying out $130M provides historical context but lacks recent comparisons. The industry consensus: NFL regular season (September-January) drives 40%+ of annual volume, with Super Bowl Sunday representing the single highest-volume day. DraftKings reported 17.7 million bets and $470M wagered on Super Bowl 59 (February 2025) company-wide, though Pick6's share is unknown.

**Growth trends 2023-2025 show diverging trajectories**. PrizePicks and Underdog—pure-play pick'em operators—demonstrate explosive growth (70-82% MAU growth for PrizePicks, 35-50% for Underdog), while DraftKings and FanDuel's traditional DFS platforms show modest 3-5% MAU growth. This divergence explains why DK and FD entered the pick'em market defensively, preventing customer migration to pick'em-focused competitors. The pick'em category is projected to capture 40% of total DFS market share by 2026, up from an estimated 20-25% in 2023.

## Prize pool structures: fixed multipliers vs. peer-to-peer variance

**PrizePicks operates a hybrid player-vs-player model** with guaranteed minimum payouts, offering the most transparent payout structure. Power Play (all picks must win) delivers fixed multipliers: 2-pick: 3x, 3-pick: 5x, 4-pick: 10x, 5-pick: 20x, 6-pick: 25x. Flex Play allows missed picks with reduced payouts (e.g., 5-pick: 10x for 5/5, 2x for 4/5, 0.4x for 3/5). The platform's innovation: **Demon Picks offering up to 2,000x multipliers** for hitting elevated projections across 6-pick lineups, typically requiring exceptional performances. Goblin Picks provide the inverse—easier projections with reduced multipliers for risk-averse players.

The current "Real Money" game uses peer-to-peer grouping: after lineup submission, users are matched into groups where the top scorer wins additional payouts beyond the minimum guarantee. Users can win either by finishing first in their group OR by hitting picks for the guaranteed multiplier, creating dual win paths. This structure evolved from regulatory pressure, as several states deemed against-the-house pick'em platforms unlicensed sports betting.

Massachusetts data reveals PrizePicks' economics: $53.6M in entries generated $10.2M in adjusted revenue over 11 months, yielding an **approximately 19% hold percentage**—substantially higher than DraftKings' traditional DFS hold of ~11% in the same market/period. This higher margin reflects favorable house odds or more losers per winner in the peer-to-peer matching system. The 19% take rate positions PrizePicks closer to sportsbook margins (typically 5-10%) than traditional DFS (10-12%), explaining the platform's exceptional profitability ($339M adjusted EBITDA on estimated $300M revenue).

**Underdog Fantasy operates dual models** across its product suite. Pick'em Standard uses fixed multipliers nearly identical to PrizePicks: 2-pick: 3x, 3-pick: 6x, 4-pick: 10x, 5-pick: 20x. Pick'em Flex/Insurance allows one missed pick with adjusted payouts. Pick8 (double flex, can miss up to 2 picks) offers up to **325x maximum multipliers** on 8-pick entries. "Scorchers"—special boosted picks marked with chili pepper icons—provide multiplier enhancements when all scorchers hit.

Best Ball tournaments use guaranteed prize pools with fixed payout structures. Best Ball Mania IV distributed $15 million to winners from $16.9M in entries, yielding an **11.2% take rate**—significantly lower than PrizePicks and confirming Underdog's operator statements of 10-15% rake. The $3 million first-place prize (20% of total pool) creates lottery-style appeal, with 10,000+ teams winning at least $250 in regular-season prizes (33% of pool) before 440 finalists competed in Week 17 championships. Underdog's Gladiator Program offers 10-50% rakeback on Battle Royale entries, further reducing effective take rates for volume players.

**DraftKings Pick6 uses pure peer-to-peer pooled prizes** without fixed multipliers, creating significant payout variability. Prize pools are pre-allocated by tiers (e.g., 80% for perfect entries, 20% for one-wrong entries), with winners sharing allocated pools equally. In a hypothetical $10,000 5-pick contest: if 320 entries achieve 5/5 correct, each wins $25 ($8,000 ÷ 320). If only 50 entries go 5/5, each wins $160. This structure creates opportunities for +EV plays when contest fill rates are low but makes payout predictability impossible.

DraftKings guarantees minimum estimated payouts in Pick6 Credits if actual payouts fall below estimates, protecting users from severe underpayment. Multiple analysts calculate **approximately 61.5% win rate required per pick** for 5-6 pick entries to achieve long-term profitability, implying a 15-20% effective take rate—higher than traditional DFS but competitive with PrizePicks. The peer-to-peer model differentiates Pick6 from PrizePicks' fixed-multiplier approach, attracting sharp players seeking contest inefficiencies while potentially deterring casual users preferring payout certainty.

**FanDuel Picks mirrors DraftKings' peer-to-peer pooled structure** with guaranteed multipliers for perfect lineups: 3/3: 2x, 4/4: 3x, 5/5: 5x, with maximum payouts up to 1,000x entry fee (contest-dependent). If perfect lineup payouts exceed the user's prize pool share, FanDuel guarantees the multiplier difference. Massachusetts data from June 2023 (pre-Picks launch, traditional DFS) showed FanDuel's $1.1M in entries generated approximately 10-15% hold—lower than PrizePicks but aligned with industry DFS standards. FanDuel Picks' specific take rate remains undisclosed, though the peer-to-peer model likely targets 10-15% to stay competitive.

**Maximum winnings vary dramatically**: PrizePicks caps standard Power Plays at 25x (6-pick) but offers 2,000x with Demon Picks; Underdog reaches 325x on Pick8; DraftKings Pick6 shows estimated 40-50x on 6-pick perfects with high variability; FanDuel advertises up to 1,000x though typical payouts are far lower. These maximum multipliers function as marketing claims rather than expected values—achieving 1,000x+ requires perfect lineups in large, underfilled contests with favorable tier allocations.

## Sport-specific data: NFL dominance amid disclosure gaps

**All four platforms offer comprehensive multi-sport coverage**—NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, college football, college basketball, PGA, UFC/MMA, NASCAR, soccer, tennis, and esports—yet **none disclose sport-specific entry volumes or revenue breakdowns**. This opacity likely reflects competitive sensitivity around which sports generate highest margins and customer lifetime value.

**NFL's dominance is evident through indirect indicators**. PrizePicks emphasizes "NFLSZN" in marketing and offers extensive NFL prop projections. Underdog Fantasy's flagship tournament is NFL-focused Best Ball Mania, attracting 677,000 entries and generating $16.9M—likely representing 30-50% of Underdog's annual revenue from a single contest. DraftKings launched Pick6 on December 6, 2023, deliberately timing the release for NFL Week 14 to capture playoff-race engagement. FanDuel Picks launched August 2025, synchronized with NFL preseason to maximize acquisition during peak sports betting season.

Industry consensus suggests **NFL accounts for 40%+ of pick'em DFS volume**, with NFL Sundays described as "tentpole acquisition and engagement days." The sport's weekly structure (Thursday-Monday games) creates concentrated betting windows, unlike NBA/MLB's daily schedules. NFL's cultural dominance, fantasy football integration, and highest TV viewership translate directly to pick'em participation. DraftKings company-wide data (not Pick6-specific) shows Super Bowl 59 generated 17.7 million bets and $470M in wagers—though sportsbook rather than pick'em, it illustrates NFL's outsized impact.

**NBA represents the second-largest volume driver** based on year-round availability (October-June) and daily game frequency. PrizePicks offers extensive NBA stat projections (points, rebounds, assists, combined PRA, fantasy points) with high player name recognition (stars drive engagement). Underdog Fantasy operates year-round NBA Best Ball tournaments and daily drafts. The 2024-2025 NBA season saw live betting handle exceed 50% of total for the first time (DraftKings company-wide metric), indicating growing prop and player-performance betting—a trend favoring pick'em formats. However, no platform discloses what percentage NBA represents vs. NFL.

**MLB provides steady mid-tier volume** during its April-October season, benefiting from statistical depth (hits, home runs, strikeouts, total bases) that enables diverse prop offerings. PrizePicks and Underdog both emphasize MLB during the long season, though promotional intensity appears lower than NFL/NBA. NHL trails the "Big Three," with lower U.S. mainstream appeal limiting pick'em engagement despite year-round availability. Ice hockey demonstrates 14.6% CAGR (fastest growth among major sports per Emergen Research), suggesting future opportunity.

**College sports face state-specific restrictions** that fragment availability. College football and college basketball are unavailable in Arkansas, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Vermont—reducing addressable market by approximately 20 million people. These restrictions reflect concerns about underage participation and athlete welfare, with some states prohibiting props on college athletes entirely. The state-by-state patchwork complicates user experience and marketing strategies, likely suppressing college sports volume below its potential.

**Esports represent an emerging vertical** with documented growth. PrizePicks reported 110%+ increase in esports entry fees from 2022 to 2023, launching "The Esports Lab" in June 2024 supporting CS2, League of Legends, and Dota 2. Underdog offers pick'em contests on League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Valorant, Call of Duty, and Dota 2. The demographic skew (younger, digitally-native users) aligns with pick'em's mobile-first design. However, esports likely represents low single-digit percentages of total volume given mainstream sports' dominance.

**Seasonal variations create significant volume swings**. NFL season (September-February) drives peak engagement, with Super Bowl representing the single highest-volume day. The April-September "dead zone" between Super Bowl and NFL kickoff challenges operators, who compensate with NBA/NHL playoffs (April-June), MLB (April-October), PGA majors, UFC events, and international soccer. PrizePicks marketing touts "100+ sports year-round" to maintain engagement during NFL off-season. Underdog Fantasy's Best Ball Mania entry window (May-September) bridges the gap, maintaining revenue during traditional DFS downturns.

Industry reports suggest fantasy platforms experienced **40% MAU increases year-round from August 2023-August 2025**, indicating successful mitigation of seasonal volatility compared to historical DFS patterns. The rise of NBA player props, MLB daily props, and global soccer coverage enables more consistent revenue vs. traditional DFS's NFL-heavy dependence.

## Market positioning: PrizePicks leads, DK/FD play catch-up

**PrizePicks dominates with decisive market leadership**: 53% market share in Arizona, Massachusetts, and Michigan combined (excluding Pennsylvania which banned pick'em games), outpacing DraftKings' 23.3% and FanDuel's 10.6% in those states. The company's $2.5 billion implied valuation (Allwyn acquisition, September 2025) for 62.3% equity stake values the entire enterprise at $4.0B with earnout potential to $4.15B. At $1 billion+ in entry fees during 2024 and $300M in estimated annual revenue with $339M adjusted EBITDA, PrizePicks operates at exceptional 113% EBITDA margin (EBITDA exceeds revenue due to accounting treatment or timing differences in the reported periods).

The platform's 45+ state footprint (plus DC and Canada excluding Ontario) covers approximately 60% of the U.S. population, including crucial non-sports-betting states California, Texas, Florida, and Georgia—collectively representing 100+ million people unavailable to sportsbook operators. This geographic advantage insulates PrizePicks from direct sportsbook competition while enabling massive growth runway. The company's 3,712% three-year growth rate (2020-2023) and consecutive #1 rankings as fastest-growing sports company (Inc. 5000, 2022-2023) underscore explosive scaling.

Massachusetts state data provides granular competitive intelligence: in June 2023, PrizePicks captured $3M in entries with $488k in adjusted revenue (16.3% hold), while DraftKings captured $5.4M in entries with $558k revenue (10.3% hold). **PrizePicks' 47% adjusted revenue share from just 28.4% entry share** demonstrates superior monetization—higher hold percentages translate to greater profitability per dollar wagered. This margin advantage enabled PrizePicks to achieve profitability years before venture-backed competitors.

**Underdog Fantasy solidifies the #2 position** with 4 million customers and $1.225B valuation (March 2025 Series C), representing 153% valuation growth from its 2022 Series B ($485M). The company raised $140M+ total funding from marquee investors including Spark Capital (lead), BlackRock, Mark Cuban, Kevin Durant, and Trae Young. As the 4th most downloaded sports gaming app in the U.S. (behind DraftKings, FanDuel, and likely BetMGR or Caesars), Underdog punches above its weight in brand awareness despite revenue estimated at $35-56M—just 12-19% of PrizePicks' scale.

Underdog's differentiation lies in **Best Ball tournament dominance**. No competitor approaches Best Ball Mania's scale: 677,000 entries and $15M prize pools dwarf alternatives. This creates dual revenue streams (Pick'em + Best Ball) and attracts distinct user segments—casual Pick'em players and serious Best Ball drafters. The platform's 41-state availability and recent Missouri expansion (August 2025, Pick'em returned after regulatory clarity) provide growth vectors, though the $17.5M New York settlement and forced 2025 exit demonstrate regulatory risks.

**DraftKings Pick6 leverages parent company advantages** while struggling with late market entry. Launching December 2023—five years after PrizePicks (2018) and three years after Underdog (2020)—the platform enters a mature competitive landscape. Operating in 34+ states including California and Texas provides scale potential, though PrizePicks' 45-state footprint offers broader reach. DraftKings' 10.1 million total customers and #2 overall sports betting market share (28% vs. FanDuel's 31-33%) create cross-selling opportunities, enabling Pick6 to acquire users more efficiently than standalone competitors.

However, **the complete absence of Pick6-specific metrics in SEC filings** signals the product's immateriality to overall results. DraftKings' $4.77B revenue (2024) derives 93% from sportsbook and iGaming, with the remaining 7% ($330M "Other" segment) combining traditional DFS, Pick6, digital lottery (Jackpocket partnership), and advertising. Analyst estimates suggest Pick6 contributes $15-35M annually—just 1.5-3.5% of PrizePicks' entry volume. CEO Jason Robins described Pick6 as a "customer acquisition tool in non-betting states" rather than standalone profit center, revealing strategic positioning as defensive rather than offensive product.

The peer-to-peer pooled prize structure differentiates Pick6 from PrizePicks' fixed multipliers, attracting sophisticated users seeking +EV opportunities when contests underfill. Yet this complexity alienates casual users preferring payout predictability. With 5% MAU growth YoY vs. PrizePicks' 82% and Underdog's 35%, Pick6 trails pick'em-focused competitors substantially. DraftKings' traditional DFS maintains ~23% market share, but that dominance hasn't transferred to pick'em—suggesting brand alone doesn't overcome three-year head starts and product-market fit advantages.

**FanDuel Picks enters as the most disadvantaged competitor**, launching just three months ago (August 2025) in only 17 states—the smallest geographic footprint among the four platforms. The late entry reflects FanDuel's sportsbook priorities: with 46% U.S. sports betting market share and #1 positions in both sportsbook and iGaming (27% share), the company focused resources on high-margin products. Picks represents a defensive move preventing customer defection to PrizePicks/Underdog in the 17 non-betting states where FanDuel lacks sportsbook licenses (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin).

Flutter Entertainment's Q3 2025 earnings call didn't mention Picks performance, instead highlighting FanDuel Predicts (prediction markets launching December 2025) and overall metrics: $5.79B revenue (2024), up 32% YoY, with projected $7.72B (2025) and $1.4B adjusted EBITDA. FanDuel's 17 million total customers dwarf Underdog's 4 million and rival DraftKings' 10.1 million, providing unmatched cross-selling potential. The launch with aggressive promotions ($60 for $5 play) demonstrates commitment to user acquisition despite late entry.

FanDuel Picks' peer-to-peer model with up to 1,000x maximum payouts mirrors DraftKings' approach, creating a duopoly of complex pooled-prize structures vs. PrizePicks/Underdog's simpler fixed multipliers. Whether Flutter's resources, brand strength, and technical infrastructure can overcome three-year market head starts remains uncertain. The platform expanded from 5 states (April 2025 soft launch) to 17 states (August 2025)—240% state expansion in four months—indicating aggressive scaling. Yet without disclosed metrics, Picks' success is unmeasurable.

**Competitive market dynamics reveal consolidation pressures**. The pick'em DFS market—estimated at $3-5B annually within the broader $13B North America DFS market—shows winner-take-most characteristics. PrizePicks' 53% share in tracked states, combined with 19% hold rates vs. competitors' 10-15%, creates durable advantages through superior unit economics. Customer acquisition costs industry-wide rose to $300-350 (up from $200-250 within 18 months), with DraftKings and FanDuel spending $1.2B+ combined on marketing (2024). Rising CAC pressures smaller operators, explaining Underdog's need for Series C funding despite strong growth and PrizePicks' attractiveness to strategic acquirer Allwyn.

Regulatory evolution favors established players: the 2024-2025 peer-to-peer pivot (following New York, Michigan, Florida, and California crackdowns on against-the-house pick'em as unlicensed sports betting) created compliance costs and user experience disruption. PrizePicks adapted fastest, launching its Arena P2P format in January 2024 and expanding to ~55% of the U.S. population under compliant models. California's Attorney General opinion (2024) declaring essentially all DFS illegal forced Underdog's exit from the nation's largest state (39M population), demonstrating ongoing regulatory risk.

**Year-over-year growth rates diverge sharply**: PrizePicks (70% entry fee growth 2024, 82% MAU growth), Underdog (153% valuation growth 2022-2025, 35% MAU growth), DraftKings company-wide (30% revenue growth, 37% customer growth, though Pick6-specific unknown), and FanDuel (32% revenue growth 2023-2024, 33% projected 2025 growth, but Picks too new for trends). The pick'em category's projected 40% DFS market share by 2026 (up from ~25% in 2023) explains why DraftKings and FanDuel entered despite late timing—the segment's growth trajectory demands presence even as followers.

## Critical data gaps and disclosure limitations

**Daily entry volumes remain entirely undisclosed** for all platforms except PrizePicks' state-level aggregates. No operator reveals daily entry counts, peak NFL Sunday volumes, or baseline weekday activity. This opacity prevents accurate revenue modeling and competitive benchmarking. PrizePicks' Massachusetts data ($53.6M over 11 months) provides monthly averages (~$4.9M/month) for a single state, but extrapolating to 45 states requires assumptions about population-adjusted participation rates, regulatory environment differences, and market maturity variations.

**Monthly unique users and monthly active users** are disclosed vaguely: PrizePicks claims "millions" without specificity beyond 3 million registered players, Underdog reports 4 million total customers without MAU breakdown, DraftKings provides company-wide 4.8 million MUPs (Q4 2024) but not Pick6-specific, and FanDuel reports 4.5 million average monthly players on sportsbook but zero Picks data. Industry analysts estimate MAU represents 20-40% of total registered users for mature platforms, suggesting PrizePicks' "millions" of MAU could range 1-3 million—but this is speculation rather than disclosure.

**Sport-specific revenue breakdowns are universally withheld**, despite NFL clearly driving 40%+ of volume. No platform discloses what percentage of entries come from NFL vs. NBA vs. MLB, preventing assessment of seasonal concentration risk and revenue predictability. This opacity likely reflects competitive sensitivity—revealing that NFL generates 60%+ of revenue would expose dependence on a single sport subject to labor disputes, injury concerns, and shifting viewership trends.

**Take rates and house percentages** are mostly disclosed indirectly or estimated. PrizePicks' ~19% hold (Massachusetts data) is the only confirmed metric, with Underdog's 10-15% estimated through Best Ball Mania prize pool math (11.2% calculated). DraftKings and FanDuel provide zero specific take rate disclosures for pick'em products. Analyst-derived breakeven win rates (61.5% per pick for DraftKings Pick6) imply 15-20% effective rakes, but these are external calculations rather than operator confirmations. Traditional DFS operators historically disclosed ~10% rakes, but the pick'em segment's opacity suggests higher margins that operators prefer to conceal from users and regulators.

**Average entry sizes, customer lifetime value, retention rates, and cohort analysis** are entirely unavailable. PrizePicks' state data shows $53.6M from likely 100,000-300,000 Massachusetts users over 11 months, implying $178-536 per user—but this requires estimating user counts. Underdog's $35-56M revenue divided by 4 million customers yields $9-14 per user annually, suggesting low monetization and high customer acquisition but retention and repeat entry rates unknown. Without these metrics, understanding whether platforms rely on whale users (high spenders) vs. mass market (broad participation) is impossible.

**Product-line profitability remains opaque** for DraftKings and FanDuel. Both companies report consolidated financial results combining sportsbook, iGaming, traditional DFS, and pick'em products. DraftKings achieved first-ever positive adjusted EBITDA in 2024 ($181M) with 2025 guidance of $900M-1B EBITDA, but Pick6's contribution vs. drag is unknown. FanDuel's $507M adjusted EBITDA (2024) and $1.4B projected (2025) includes no Picks breakout. Whether these pick'em products are profitable, breakeven, or customer acquisition losses disguised within overall results is undeterminable from public filings.

**Regulatory compliance costs and legal settlements** appear occasionally—Underdog's $17.5M New York settlement (2025), PrizePicks' Maryland discontinuation (December 2023), and various state-by-state regulatory negotiations—but total legal expenses, compliance overhead, and regulatory risk provisioning remain undisclosed. The peer-to-peer pivot industry-wide (2024-2025) imposed product redesign costs, user experience friction, and potential revenue losses that no operator has quantified publicly.

**State-by-state performance data exists only for four states** with DFS reporting requirements: Arizona, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (which banned pick'em games). This limits competitive intelligence to ~3% of the U.S. population despite 45+ state operations. Most states treat DFS as fantasy gaming exempt from sports betting licensing and reporting, creating deliberate regulatory blind spots. Operators lobby to maintain this classification, as sports betting oversight would impose reserve requirements, responsible gaming obligations, and revenue disclosures.

**App download and user engagement metrics** from third-party sources (Sensor Tower, Apptopia) provide limited visibility. Underdog's "4th most downloaded sports gaming app" ranking confirms competitive positioning, but download counts don't translate directly to active users or revenue. DraftKings and FanDuel's dominant app store presence reflects their sportsbook scale, not pick'em product performance specifically. Without operator-disclosed DAU/MAU metrics, third-party estimates remain directionally useful but quantitatively unreliable.

## Conclusion

PrizePicks' market dominance stems from first-mover advantage, geographic reach, and superior unit economics (19% hold vs. 10-15% competitors), translating $1B+ entry fees into $339M EBITDA and a $2.5B acquisition valuation. Underdog Fantasy's Best Ball differentiation and $1.225B valuation confirm viable #2 positioning despite 3x smaller scale. DraftKings and FanDuel's pick'em products remain strategic experiments rather than revenue drivers, with both companies declining to disclose specific metrics in public filings—a silence that speaks volumes about early-stage performance and priorities. 

The industry's pervasive data opacity—particularly regarding daily volumes, sport-specific breakdowns, and product-line profitability—reflects competitive sensitivities and regulatory advantages from maintaining fantasy gaming classification rather than sports betting oversight. Researchers seeking granular operational metrics will find only PrizePicks' state-level disclosures and Underdog's selective tournament data, with DraftKings and FanDuel offering virtually nothing beyond company-wide aggregates. As peer-to-peer models reshape payout structures and regulatory scrutiny intensifies, the platforms best positioned for sustainable growth are those with proven unit economics and multi-state scale—attributes currently exclusive to PrizePicks and Underdog Fantasy.
