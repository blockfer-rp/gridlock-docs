# Pick'Em Platform Entry Mechanics Compared

**All four platforms charge entry fees per lineup, not per pick**—a $10 entry on a 4-pick lineup costs exactly $10 total. But the operational differences diverge significantly from there, particularly in multi-entry limits (PrizePicks allows only 1 lineup per contest while FanDuel permits up to 5,000 entries per slate) and payout structures (PrizePicks and Underdog offer fixed multipliers against the house, while DraftKings Pick6 and FanDuel Picks use peer-to-peer prize pools).

## Entry cost structure works identically across platforms with one critical variance

Every platform charges **one flat fee per lineup submission**, regardless of how many picks (2-6 players) you include. The key distinction lies in how that fee translates to contest entries.

**PrizePicks, Underdog Fantasy, and FanDuel Picks** treat your entry amount as a single submission. A $10 entry means you're paying $10 once to submit that specific lineup. Entry amounts range from $1 minimum to $500-$750 maximum depending on the platform and user limits. Your payout potential scales with the number of picks you include—a 4-pick lineup at $10 pays higher multipliers than a 2-pick lineup at $10 because successfully hitting more picks is harder.

**DraftKings Pick6 operates differently**. When you submit a $10 entry, the platform automatically distributes it as **10 separate $1 contest entries** using your same lineup. Each dollar creates an independent contest entry competing against other users. The $1-per-contest model is hardcoded into Pick6's structure, so a $150 maximum entry equals 150 individual contest entries. According to their official documentation: "It costs $1 for every contest entered, so a $10 bet grants a player 10 entries of the same lineup."

**Concrete example across all platforms:** Building a 4-pick lineup (Mahomes passing yards, Kelce receptions, CMC rushing yards, Tyreek receiving yards) with a $10 entry:

- **PrizePicks:** Pay $10 once. Win 10x ($100) if all 4 hit on Power Play, or lower amounts on Flex Play depending on how many picks hit.
- **Underdog:** Pay $10 once. Win 10x ($100) if all 4 hit standard mode, reduced if using Insurance/Flex option.
- **DraftKings Pick6:** Pay $10 total, distributed as 10 separate $1 entries of your lineup across multiple contests. Your payout depends on how your lineup ranks against other users in each contest (variable).
- **FanDuel Picks:** Pay $10 total for 10 entries of your lineup. Win based on guaranteed multiplier (3x for 4/4 perfect) plus your share of contest prize pools.

Minimum entry fees start at $1 across all platforms. Maximum limits vary by platform and user history—PrizePicks states "limits vary depending on the Member, sport, or stat-type," Underdog allows up to $500 per single Pick'em entry, DraftKings caps at $150, and FanDuel uses exposure-based limits per player and sport.

**Pick requirements** differ slightly by platform: PrizePicks and Underdog allow 2-6 picks per lineup, DraftKings Pick6 allows 2-6 picks (3+ required in Colorado), and FanDuel Picks requires 3-6 picks minimum. All platforms require picks from the same sport within each lineup—no cross-sport mixing allowed.

## Multi-entry capabilities separate PrizePicks from mass-entry competitors

**PrizePicks enforces the most restrictive multi-entry policy**: users can submit **only 1 lineup per contest**, period. Their official help center explicitly states: "Members may only submit 1 Lineup per PrizePicks contest." This is a fundamental architectural difference from traditional DFS sites and represents a deliberate choice to prevent multi-entry "sharps" from dominating the player pool. The platform doesn't allow creating variations of lineups for the same slate—you build one lineup, choose your entry amount, and that's your sole entry. Multi-accounting (creating additional accounts to circumvent this) is strictly prohibited and violates terms of service across all jurisdictions.

Instead of multi-entry strategies, PrizePicks uses a **peer-to-peer grouping system** that matches your single lineup with other users based on number of picks, lineup type (Power Play vs Flex Play), user experience level, and submission time. This creates competition without requiring users to submit dozens of lineup variations.

**Underdog Fantasy, DraftKings Pick6, and FanDuel Picks all permit extensive multi-entry** with varying limits:

**Underdog Fantasy** allows **150 entries maximum** per major tournament (Best Ball Mania, The Big Board). For Pick'em contests, users face per-player exposure limits—$750 maximum total across all pending entries on any single player's projections—rather than hard entry caps. The platform employs a fairness algorithm: "If you enter with more than one lineup, your entries will start in separate groups for Round 1" to prevent same-user dominance in individual pods. Users can submit completely different lineups with overlapping players or fully distinct player selections.

**DraftKings Pick6** sets **150 entries maximum per individual contest**. The platform uses a three-tier distribution priority system when you submit multiple entries: (1) contests where you have no existing entries, (2) contests where you have entries from different lineups, (3) contests where you already have entries from the same lineup up to the 150-entry cap. According to TheLines.com: "The point is to make sure you don't have multiple entries in the same contest" by intelligently distributing across available contests. While you can have more than 150 active entries on a given night across multiple contests, the per-contest cap prevents concentration.

**FanDuel Picks** offers the highest multi-entry limits at **up to 5,000 contests per slate** across all contests, with sport-specific caps: NFL (1,500 contests), NBA/MLB (1,000 contests), NHL (500 contests), CFB/CBB (250 contests). Per-contest limits restrict users to 3% of total entries for contests with 2-4,999 entries, or 150 entries maximum for contests with 5,000+ entries. The automatic distribution system follows the same priority as DraftKings—preferencing contests without your entries, then contests with different lineups, then contests with the same lineup.

**There are no restrictions on overlapping players between multiple lineups** on any of the three multi-entry platforms. You can use the same players across different lineup variations, build completely distinct lineups, or employ any combination strategy. The distribution algorithms ensure your entries spread across different contests to maintain fairness and reduce same-user clustering.

**Strategic implications for mass-entry users:** Underdog, DraftKings, and FanDuel all support traditional DFS strategies of submitting multiple lineup variations to capture different game scenarios and reduce variance. Common approaches include building a "core" of high-confidence plays and varying the remaining slots, creating positively-correlated stacks for upside, or constructing contrarian lineups to differentiate from field ownership. PrizePicks users must commit to a single lineup construction, making pick selection more consequential but eliminating the "spray and pray" approach common in high-volume DFS play.

## Correlated picks are broadly permitted with sport-specific restrictions

All four platforms **encourage correlation strategies** while maintaining a universal baseline rule: lineups must contain players from **at least 2 different teams**. Beyond that requirement, correlation rules diverge significantly based on each platform's same-player policies.

**PrizePicks offers the most permissive correlation environment** and recently introduced an exclusive feature called "Stacks" that allows selecting **up to 3 different stat projections for the same player** in a single lineup. Examples include combining an NFL player's rush yards + rush/rec TDs + receptions, or an MLB pitcher's strikeouts + pitching outs + hits allowed. The restriction: you cannot pick the same stat type twice (can't select "Points" twice for the same player). This Stacks feature is currently available for NFL, CFB, MLB, and WNBA, with NBA coming soon.

Traditional same-team stacking is fully allowed on PrizePicks—QB + WR from the same team, multiple teammates from the same game, cross-sport mixing (though picks must be from same game day). The only sport-specific restriction applies to MLB: you cannot pair a pitcher with an opposing batter in the same lineup, but you can combine a pitcher with same-team batters or multiple batters from the same team.

According to third-party analysis from Medium, correlation significantly improves ROI: "At 10% correlation between picks, breakeven rate drops from ~56-57% to ~52% for Flex 5s and Power 4s... You *definitely* want to be correlating your plays, especially when betting power plays." PrizePicks may adjust payout multipliers for heavily correlated lineups. Their documentation notes: "Payouts could be different than standard—usually when a Lineup contains players from the same team or game," though specific adjustment formulas aren't publicly disclosed.

**Underdog Fantasy prohibits same-player stacking in Pick'em** but fully supports same-team correlation. Their official rule states: "Users may not stack props from the same player in the same Pick'em entry either, which includes Rivals selections." You cannot combine Patrick Mahomes passing yards Higher + Mahomes rushing yards Higher in the same entry. However, QB + WR same-team stacking is explicitly recommended in Underdog's own documentation: "The strongest correlations are between QB-WR and QB-TE because the quarterback literally throws the football to the WR and TE. When a WR catches a touchdown, the QB gets points too."

Underdog's Best Ball format (season-long draft tournaments) actively encourages stacking strategies. From FTN Fantasy: "Stacking in best ball boosts scoring potential by drafting players from the same team, like quarterbacks and wide receivers, whose performances are correlated." The platform maintains the 2-team minimum but places no caps on same-team players beyond that. Recommended correlation examples include QB + WR same team (strongest), QB + TE same team, NBA point guard assists + teammate points, or center rebounds Higher + teammate rebounds Lower (inverse correlation).

**DraftKings Pick6 takes the strictest same-player stance**: "Once a player is selected, they cannot be selected again for a different pick in the same Pick Set. For example, an NFL player can be picked for passing yards OR interceptions thrown, not both." You cannot stack Lamar Jackson passing yards and rushing yards, or Travis Kelce receiving yards and receptions.

Same-team stacking remains fully viable—QB + WR from the same team, multiple teammates in one lineup, opposing players from the same game. The platform's peer-to-peer structure rewards correlation-based game scripts. From TheLines.com: "Optimal lineups might have positive or negative correlations between players on the same team. Paint a picture of how the game might unfold and make your picks based on what you feel is the most likely outcome." Examples include pairing RB rushing yards Under with QB passing yards Over (negative correlation reflecting game script where team falls behind), or stacking opposing QBs in projected shootouts.

**FanDuel Picks allows same-player multiple stats with overlapping restrictions**. Their rules explicitly state: "Yes, you can select a player multiple times in the same picks set, but must make picks from players of at least two (2) different teams." The restriction targets overlapping stat categories:

- **NFL/NCAAF:** Cannot combine receiving yards and receptions for same player
- **NBA:** Cannot combine points and assists for same player
- **MLB:** Cannot combine hits and singles for same player
- **NHL:** Cannot combine shots on goal and goals for same player

Non-overlapping combinations work fine—you could theoretically select a player's rushing yards and receiving yards if those don't overlap in FanDuel's categorization. Same-team stacking (QB + WR, multiple players from same game) is fully permitted.

Critically, **FanDuel dynamically adjusts guaranteed multipliers based on detected correlation**: "The guaranteed multiplier varies based on the number of picks in the lineup, players, and stat selected. The multipliers account for the level of difficulty and any correlation between the picks in your lineup. Your guaranteed multiplier will be displayed within the product before entry and will adjust with each pick you select." More heavily correlated picks may yield lower multipliers, but the system allows you to see the adjustment in real-time before submitting, providing full transparency on how your correlation strategy affects expected value.

**Common correlation strategies that work across platforms:**

- QB + pass catcher same team (strongest positive correlation)
- Same-game environment stacking (multiple Overs in high-total games)
- Inverse team correlation (RB Under + QB Over for negative game script)
- Opposing skill positions in shootouts (QB + opposing WR)
- MLB pitcher + same-team batters (pitcher success and run support)
- NBA power play units (defensemen + forwards on same line)

## Operational mechanics reveal fundamentally different business models

The four platforms diverge most dramatically in their **payout structures and competitive frameworks**—differences that affect user experience far beyond entry fees and correlation rules.

**PrizePicks and Underdog Fantasy (Pick'em mode) operate as against-the-house platforms** with fixed multiplier tables. Users compete against predetermined projections set by the platform rather than against other users' lineups. PrizePicks offers two distinct modes: **Power Play** (all-or-nothing requiring all picks to hit, with payouts from 3x for 2-pick to 37.5x for 6-pick) and **Flex Play** (forgiving format paying reduced amounts even with misses—a 5-pick Flex pays for 3/5, 4/5, or 5/5 outcomes).

PrizePicks introduced unique difficulty tiers: **Demon Picks** (red icon, harder projections paying up to 2,000x) and **Goblin Picks** (green icon, easier projections with lower multipliers). For example, if LeBron's standard projection is 24.5 points, a Demon pick might be 29.5 points (harder to hit, higher payout) while a Goblin pick might be 21.5 points (easier to hit, lower payout). The platform also offers a hybrid competitive element—every lineup enters both a guaranteed payout structure AND a peer-to-peer group where the highest scorer wins up to 10x their entry. Scoring in groups weights Demon wins at 1.05 points, standard wins at 1 point, and Goblin wins at 0.95 points.

Underdog's Pick'em similarly provides fixed multipliers (2-pick = 3x, 3-pick = 6x, 4-pick = 10x, 5-pick = 20x) with optional Insurance/Flex reducing payouts for partial wins. Exclusive features include **Rivals** (head-to-head player matchups with adjusted spreads like "Justin Herbert more passing yards than Joe Burrow +25 yards") and **Scorchers** (boost multipliers by 1.5x-2.5x up to 100x if the designated "scorcher" pick hits—indicated by a pepper icon). Underdog also offers a peer-to-peer variant called **Pick'em Champions** where users earn Champions Points based on difficulty and accuracy, splitting prize pools proportionally.

**DraftKings Pick6 and FanDuel Picks both use peer-to-peer parimutuel models** where users compete against each other, not the house. This fundamental architecture creates variable payouts based on field performance and introduces strategic depth around contrarian play.

DraftKings Pick6 **automatically distributes your entries across multiple $1 contests** without letting you choose specific contests. Prize pools split among winners in tiers (6/6, 5/6, 4/6, etc.). A critical fairness rule: if a lower tier pays more per entry than a higher tier due to pool distribution, DraftKings manually credits the difference. Official example: "If 100 entries got 6/6 correct splitting $500 ($5 each), but only 25 entries got 5/6 correct splitting $200 ($8 each), DraftKings will credit each 6/6 winner an additional $3 to match the 5/6 payout."

Pick6 includes **Live Picks** (make selections on games already in progress, scored on full-game stats not remaining stats), promotional **Stat Slices** (reduced projections making "More" easier to hit), and a unique **push/tie rule**: ties count as correct for "More" selections and incorrect for "Less" selections (opposite of traditional sportsbook rules where ties typically push). The platform integrates with the broader DraftKings ecosystem—unified account balances across Sportsbook, Casino, and traditional DFS; Dynasty Rewards earning Crowns for every entry; and cross-platform promotional eligibility.

**FanDuel Picks employs a dual payout system** combining guaranteed multipliers with prize pool splitting: "If the Prize Pool split is greater than the guaranteed multiplier, the Prize Pool split will be awarded. If the Prize Pool split is less than the guaranteed multiplier, FanDuel will credit the difference to ensure the guaranteed multiplier is met." This hedges against both low-winner scenarios (where you'd benefit from larger prize pool shares) and high-winner scenarios (where the guarantee protects you from diluted payouts).

Concrete example from official FanDuel rules: In a 5-pick contest with 20x guaranteed multiplier, if you enter $1 (expecting $20 for perfect lineup) and 25 users go 5/5 perfect splitting a $700 prize pool, you receive $28 per entry ($700 ÷ 25 = $28, which exceeds the $20 guarantee). But if 40 users go 5/5 perfect, the math yields $17.50 per winner ($700 ÷ 40)—FanDuel credits the $2.50 difference to ensure you receive the guaranteed $20.

FanDuel's **"Mild" vs "Spicy" pick system** (green/red pepper icons) allows users to control risk-reward profiles. Spicy picks use harder projections contributing to multipliers up to 1,000x, while Mild picks offer easier lines with lower multiplier contributions. According to BettingUSA user testing: "I recently built a lineup consisting of six spicy picks with a 1,000x payout multiplier. Swapping one spicy pick for a neutral selection resulted in no change to the payout multiplier but made my prediction significantly easier. Even after switching out an additional spicy pick, the lineup still offered a sizeable 793x multiplier." This system lets users optimize the difficulty-to-payout ratio.

FanDuel streamlines the entry process by **eliminating lobby navigation entirely**—no choosing between contest types or browsing available tournaments. Build your lineup, set your entry amount (each dollar = one contest entry), and the system automatically distributes entries based on the same priority algorithm as DraftKings (preferencing contests without your entries first, then contests with different lineups, then contests with the same lineup).

**Additional platform-specific features worth noting:**

**PrizePicks** offers promotional features including Discounted Projections (limited-time lowered projections with gold banner and countdown timer) and Max Discount (ultra-discounted "1-Point Wins" where player needs just 1 unit of required stat to win). The platform allows entry cancellation only within 5 minutes of submission if no athletes have started play, entry fee is $5 or greater, and only for full-game projections. If players don't play (DNP) or tie projections (push), lineups "revert" to the next tier down—a 5-pick Power Play becomes a 4-pick Power Play payout.

**Underdog Fantasy** offers Best Ball tournaments as their signature feature beyond Pick'em. Best Ball uses a "set it and forget it" approach: draft once in snake format (18 rounds for NFL with specific position requirements), then the platform automatically optimizes your highest-scoring players each week with zero management required. Best Ball Mania tournaments feature massive prize pools ($10+ million) with advancement structures across multiple rounds. The platform also offers Weekly Winners (Best Ball format with weekly prizes instead of season-long advancement) and a Rescue feature for Pick'em (injury protection if player misses entire second half).

**DraftKings Pick6** differentiates with transparent prize tier display showing exactly how pools split across scoring outcomes. The platform has no late swap feature—picks are final after submission, unlike traditional DFS where you can swap players until game time. Voided picks (players not meeting minimum play requirements like recording at least 1 snap in NFL) drop the lineup to a lower pick level with minimum guaranteed payout awarded in cash and difference refunded in Pick6 Credits.

**FanDuel Picks** requires 3 picks minimum (higher than competitors' 2-pick minimum) but offers better payouts than PrizePicks as pick counts increase, according to OddsAssist comparisons. The platform's void policy differs from competitors—if a player meets minimum play requirements (1 snap in NFL) but exits early due to injury, stats still count as a loss rather than voiding. After voids, perfect lineups pay: 5/5 = 5x, 4/4 = 3x, 3/3 = 2x, 2/2 = refund. Lineups must contain at least 3 players across 2 different teams after voids or they're invalidated with refund.

## Platform positioning and strategic fit

**PrizePicks** serves recreational users wanting single-lineup simplicity with fixed payouts and risk-control modes (Power/Flex Play). The Stacks feature for same-player multi-stat selection is exclusive and creates unique correlation opportunities. The single-entry-per-contest limit prevents mass-entry professionals from dominating the player pool, making it more accessible for casual players. Best for: Users who want straightforward entries without building dozens of lineup variations, and those who value predictable fixed multipliers over variable peer-to-peer payouts.

**Underdog Fantasy** bridges casual and serious DFS play by combining both daily Pick'em AND season-long Best Ball tournaments. The 150-entry limit on major tournaments (Best Ball Mania with $10+ million prize pools) attracts serious DFS players while remaining manageable for casuals. Rivals head-to-head matchups and Scorchers add strategic variety beyond standard Pick'em. The platform's transparent rake display (typically 10-11.5%) and highest 3-pick payouts (6x vs 5x elsewhere) provide competitive value. Best for: Users wanting tournament exposure with both daily and season-long formats, and those prioritizing fixed multipliers with optional flex/insurance modes.

**DraftKings Pick6** appeals to users comfortable with variable peer-to-peer payouts and wanting integration with the broader DraftKings ecosystem. The automatic $1 contest distribution removes lobby navigation complexity while the 150-entry per-contest limit allows substantial multi-entry strategies. Live Picks during games offer unique angles for in-game opportunities. The peer-to-peer structure rewards contrarian thinking—unpopular picks that hit yield larger prize pool shares. Best for: Existing DraftKings users leveraging Dynasty Rewards across platforms, serious DFS players building multiple lineup variations, and those who prefer competing against the field rather than fixed house lines.

**FanDuel Picks** combines peer-to-peer competition with downside protection through guaranteed multipliers, offering the best of both worlds. Maximum multi-entry capacity (5,000 contests per slate) dwarfs competitors and supports the most sophisticated multi-entry strategies. The Mild/Spicy difficulty system allows fine-tuning correlation and challenge levels within a single lineup while seeing real-time multiplier adjustments. The dual payout system (guaranteed multiplier + prize pool splitting) protects against both low-winner and high-winner scenarios. Best for: High-volume DFS players building extensive lineup portfolios, users who want peer-to-peer upside with guaranteed minimums, and those prioritizing transparency in correlation-adjusted pricing.

## Conclusion: Different platforms for different approaches

The deceptively simple entry cost structure—one flat fee per lineup regardless of pick count—masks profound operational differences that create distinct user experiences. **PrizePicks** restricts users to one lineup per contest with fixed against-the-house payouts, prioritizing simplicity and recreational accessibility over multi-entry strategy complexity. **Underdog Fantasy** bridges both worlds by combining Pick'em (150-entry tournament limits, fixed multipliers) with unique Best Ball season-long formats that attract serious tournament players. **DraftKings Pick6** and **FanDuel Picks** both employ peer-to-peer structures rewarding contrarian thinking and allowing mass-entry strategies (150 and 5,000 contest limits respectively), but FanDuel's guaranteed multipliers provide downside protection that Pick6's pure parimutuel model lacks.

Correlation strategies work across all platforms—same-team stacking, same-game environment plays, and game-script narratives remain viable everywhere—but same-player multi-stat selection varies dramatically. PrizePicks exclusively offers "Stacks" (3 stats per player), FanDuel permits non-overlapping stat combinations with dynamic multiplier adjustments, DraftKings prohibits same-player selections entirely, and Underdog falls in between by allowing same-player picks only in Best Ball drafts. For users building correlation-heavy lineups, understanding each platform's multiplier adjustment systems (FanDuel's real-time transparency, PrizePicks' Demon/Goblin tiers, Underdog's Scorchers) becomes critical to maximizing expected value.

The fundamental choice comes down to **fixed multipliers versus variable peer-to-peer payouts**. PrizePicks and Underdog offer predictability—you know exactly what you'll win if your picks hit. DraftKings Pick6 and FanDuel Picks offer variability—contrarian plays can yield outsized returns when the field zigs and you zag, but popular picks that hit may pay less due to prize pool dilution. For recreational players prioritizing simplicity, PrizePicks' single-lineup model and fixed payouts provide the clearest path. For serious DFS players leveraging correlation models and multi-entry portfolios, FanDuel's 5,000-entry capacity and guaranteed multiplier floor create the most flexible strategic environment.
