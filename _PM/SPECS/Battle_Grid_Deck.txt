Core_team

Crypto trading behaviour has fundamentally shifted:





The meme-coin era created a generation that values speed over patience, competition over isolation, and skill over luck. They don't want to hold — they want to compete.
The explosive rise of competitive trading and prediction market formats reflects this shift — serving an audience that demands instant feedback, head-to-head competition, and the rush of proving their edge in real time.





The_new_player_mindset

Hypergrid sits at the convergence of three explosive markets. We turn prediction markets and perps trading into head-to-head competitions where players wager on their forecasting and trading skill.



$81.4B GGR in 2024 (5x since 2022)
17M+ daily active users, 70% QoQ growth


PREDICTION MARKETS: ~$3B monthly volume (40% of $7.4B total) 18x YoY growth in crypto betting category

</Market_data_highlights >
The_opportunity
DECENTRALIZED PERPS TRADING: $2.6T annual volume (2024) 600K+ active users, 138% YoY growth

Phase 1 – Competitive Forecasting Arenas
</MarketGrid >
MarketGrid is where players prove their market intuition. Predict which tokens will outperform within categories, arrange them strategically on a 3×3 grid, and compete for the pot, XP, and jackpot by forming winning patterns.
Power-ups add strategic depth: HIGH_VOLATILITY targets explosive movers, LOW_VOLATILITY captures stable performers — amplifying points when you read the market correctly.
Every game builds your public track record. Win rates, pattern completions, and forecasting accuracy establish credibility for sponsors, trading competitions, and TradeGrid advancement.
Prove market intuition here → Compete with leverage there.


Introducing_HYPERGRID

Phase 1 – Competitive Forecasting Arenas
</CandleGrid >
CandleGrid tests directional momentum over time. Players select one asset (SOL, ETH, or BTC) and predict whether each sequential candle closes higher or lower across 12–24 time periods. Compete for the pot, XP, and jackpot by accurately forecasting trend continuation, reversals, and volatility windows.

Power-ups target timing precision: HIGH_VOLATILITY identifies explosive price swings within your sequence, LOW_VOLATILITY captures tight-range candles — both amplifying points when you correctly anticipate market behavior.

Players who master temporal forecasting — predicting when trends form, persist, or reverse — build the sequential decision-making skills essential for TradeGrid’s fast-paced leveraged trading.

Forecast momentum sequences here → Execute timed entries there.

Phase 2 — MVP
</Tradegrid >
Tradegrid is the centerpiece of the Hypergrid ecosystem — a decentralized PvP trading platform where players compete in timed trading sessions for a winner-takes-all reward. As the ecosystem evolves, weekly elimination tournaments, team battles, and player-hosted matches will launch — with hosts earning 5% of the action

Core Revenue Driver
Hypergrid earns a 5% rake on every wagered PvP match — a scalable, volume-based model directly tied to player activity and engagement.

Supplementary Streams
Additional revenue comes from builder and referral fees, with a portion redistributed back into the economy as in-game credits to reward ongoing participation.

Bonus Upside
Through active builder and referral participation, Hypergrid is well positioned to capture future airdrop rewards from the HYPE ecosystem.

</From Stagnation to Opportunity >
PVP.trade’s growth plateaued mainly because it never advanced beyond its Telegram interface. The community has been waiting for meaningful progression for months, yet no new features or engagement layers were introduced. There were no incentives to keep players locked in — no XP farming, no rewards, no jackpots, just a static leaderboard. For the high builder fees users were paying, there was no sense of value or progression tied to their activity.
Hypergrid was built to fix exactly that — refining PVP.trade’s product–market fit and evolving it into a circular, player-first economy where every match, trade, and referral fuels jackpots, free credits, and rewards — ensuring value constantly flows back to the players, not away from them.
